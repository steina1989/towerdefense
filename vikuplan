Goals:

Week 1
Render framework, plan project and labour divison.
Define models: Arena, Balloon, Bullet, Tower.
Design rendering with placeholders (circles/squares etc).


Week 2
Balloon.update (movement) - balloons follow correct path.
Tower.update (shooting) - towers aim and shoot successfully
(do not need to hit balloons yet).
Towers placeable in legal areas.


Week 3
Collision: Bullets from towers hit balloons; balloons die
and bullets die.
When bullets hit balloons, score is increased.

When balloons finish their path and roll off the canvas,
"lives" is decremented.

Finishing touches.
